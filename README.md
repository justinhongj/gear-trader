# Gear Trader

#About
Gear Trader is an app that facilitates trading of used musical gear. Once a user registers an account, they can create, watch, and make offers on posts. There is also a built-in messenger to make communication between users easier.

#Technologies Used
This app is built using Ruby on Rails, with the help of Bcrypt and Faker Gems. Bootstrap was used for the majority of the styling.

#Approach
The app was modeled around similar sites such as Craigslist. It is designed to be easy to use and easy to navigate. A crucial part of trading gear is communication between both parties, which is why the built-in messenger was included. 

The profile page allows the user to quickly keep track of and manage their own posts. All trade offers made for a particular post can also be seen here. The user can also keep track of posts that they are watching, and the trade offers that they have made on other posts.

#Future Additions
Unfortunately, the app does not yet support uploading images, but this is a priority to be implemented. 

Smaller additions such as leaving a Trade Rating for another user and adding a Comments section to each post will also be implemented, along with others.
